# Binance
A wrapper for the Binance REST and WebSocket APIs. Uses promises only, and allows
for either direct access to the API, or for wrapped access with helper functionality
such as request limiting and parsing datatypes. For more information, please read the [Official Binanace API Docs](https://github.com/binance-exchange/binance-official-api-docs).

# UPDATE

This repository will no longer be maintained and is purely for referece.
Binance is no longer available in Canada as of December 2021, therefore there is no longer a use for this API for my use case.
