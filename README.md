# Binance
A wrapper for the Binance REST and WebSocket APIs. Uses promises only, and allows
for either direct access to the API, or for wrapped access with helper functionality
such as request limiting and parsing datatypes. For more information, please read the [Official Binanace API Docs](https://github.com/binance-exchange/binance-official-api-docs).
